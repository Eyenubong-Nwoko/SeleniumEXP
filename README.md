The purpose of this project is to aid Varsity Tutor professionals with the process of securing instant opportunities. Any Varsity Tutor contract work understands the frustration of missing a potential opprunity that pops up. Maybe you were just .5 seconds late to click on it and your 15 seconds starts a little bit later so you can't land the opporutunity. Perhaps you were in the restroom at the time of the pop-up and you miss the opportunity. Whatever the reason, my program aims to help tutors secure these opportunities at the time they appear. I am hoping to recreate this program with JS and Selenium later on to better interact with the webpage. 
Their is some setup process involved to run this code but after setup it takes one click to run and everything else is handled for you!
